NedoOS -- Multitasking operating system for ZX Spectrum
=======================================================

Features
--------

* Works with TR-DOS floppies, SD-card, IDE HDD (FAT12/16 or FAT32 with
  long filenames support). Device letters:
  - "E".."H" - IDE HDD (Master),
  - "I".."L" - IDE HDD (Slave),
  - "M" - SD-card (Z-controller),
  - "N" - SD-card (NeoGS),
  - "O" - USB flash,
  - "A".."D" - TR-DOS floppies. IDE controller (ATM or Nemo IDE) depends
    on the batch file you run. Includes support for segmented TR-DOS files
    of any size (according to TR-DOS sequential access files standard).
* Up to 16 tasks running at the same time. Tasks may be active (one of them
  has the focus, so it can read input devices and print on visible
  terminal screen) or frozen. Tasks may give away their time slot to
  the system using `YIELD`, but don't have to.
* NedoOS can open up to 8 files on FAT, up to 8 files on TR-DOS, and
  up to 8 pipes between tasks at the same time.
* User program can access the whole memory between 0x0100..0xffff, any 16K
  window can be switched via OS calls (see below). File operations and
  BDOS data transfer can be done at any address in the userspace.
* User programs can modify the interrupt handler (for example, to restore
  stack data) and move the stack pointer.
* Gfx editor Scratch, music players NedoPlayer and modplay, text editor texted,
  disk image mounter dmm, snapshot runner/switcher nmisvc, compiler NedoLang,
  assembler NedoAsm, basic interpreter NedoBasic, picture viewer NedoView,
  decompressors for `*.zip`, `*.gz`, `*.rar`, `*.tar` and archivers for `*.rar` and
  `*.tar`, network utilities (NedoBrowser, dmirc, dmftp, netterm etc.), games...

System requirements
-------------------

* ATM Turbo 2 or ATM3 compatible computer (depends on the main executable)
* Kempston mouse with a wheel recommended
* SD-card recommended (Z-Controller with shadow ports or NeoGS) or
  harddrive (NemoIDE or ATM IDE)
* DDp's palette scheme (4+4+4) recommended
* Real-time clock (Mr.Gluk's schematics) recommended
* ZXNETUSB network interface card recommended
* General Sound or NeoGS sound card recommended
* TurboSound FM sound card recommended

Keyboard shortcuts
------------------

NedoOS handles keys and mouse events and forwards them to the task that
is in focus. The key combinations Ext+letter (Tab+letter) correspond to
ASCII control codes 1..26. The Ext+Number key combinations
(Tab+Number, CapsShift+SymbolShift+Number) are equivalent to function
keys F1..F10 on a PS/2 keyboard.

Keyboard shortcuts used by the kernel (PS/2 shortcuts are shown in brackets):

* Caps Shift (Left Shift) - hold down to stop scrolling on the screen
* Symbol Shift + Enter (Right Shift + Enter) - switches visual tasks (that
  is, those that called `CMD_SETGFX`), while the task to which they were
  switched receives the `key_redraw` key code (upon learning this, it can
  redraw the screen)
* C+M+D (press simultaneously) - execute `cmd.com` if there are no active
  tasks. (polled in the idle task, so it works only when there are no active
  tasks). To spawn a new terminal, use the command `term`.
* Caps Shift + 2 (Caps Lock) - switch case
* Caps Shift + 1 (Alt + Shift) - switch between keyboard layouts
  (Russian/English). In the Russian mode (it also supports the Ukrainian
  language), the ШВЕРТЫ layout is enabled. In this case, you can type some
  letters by two presses (ja=я, jo=ё, ju=ю, je=є, ji=ї, jy=i, cg=ґ, cc=ц,
  hh=э, jj=ъ). Because letters "й", "ц", "ш", "э" are used as a prefix of
  combinations, you can input them separately by pressing any other key after
  them that is not included in their combination. The key pressed afterward
  is not ignored, but also processed. In the literary text, the combinations
  "йа", "йо", "йу", "йe", "чч", "хх", "йи", "йы", "йй", "цг" are practically
  excluded (sometimes in foreign words). To enter such combinations use
  cursor movement. All punctuation marks available in Latin mode are also
  available in Russian. The Russian encoding is CP866 and CP1125 is used
  as Ukrainian encoding.
* Ext+Enter (Tab+Enter, Caps Shift+Symbol Shift+Enter, use Tab+Right Shift+Enter
  on incompatible keyboards) - switch on/off
  the pseudo-graphic input mode
* In case of TR-DOS errors (the  red border is shown), the R (Retry), I
  (Ignore sector), A (Abort) keys work.

cmd -- Command interpreter
--------------------------

It is an interactive prompt (command line) with scrolling to the left and
right. Cursor key Up will recall the previous command.

Following file types are executed (the first character of the extension is
checked):

* .com (the extension can be omitted) - an executable program, a new
  parallel process is created. Command-line parameters are passed to the
  process to the `COMMANDLINE` address (see the "Programming" section).

* .bat is a sequence of commands that `cmd` understands, including starting
  .com programs (commands are executed sequentially and not concurrently,
  except when the `start` command is used). Each command is shown on the
  screen before it is executed.

Programs located in the `bin/` directory of the system disk can be executed
in the command line from any directory of any disk (the current directory
has priority for calling programs before the `bin/` directory). The current
directory does not change when programs are executed.

The following commands (and their aliases) are supported:

* `exit` - quit cmd
* `a:` ... `o:` - change the current disk
* `dir (ls)` - list the content of the current directory. You can redirect
  output to a file: `dir> filename`
* `cd <path>` - change the current directory to <path>. <path> can contain
  a drive name.
* `cd ..` - change directory to the parent directory.
* `md (mkdir) <path/dirname>` - create a new directory with the specified
  name in the current or the specified path
* `del (rm) <path/filename>` - delete a file or an empty directory in the
  current directory
* `copy (cp) <path/filename> <newpath/newfilename>` - copy file
* `ren <path/filename> <newpath/newfilename>` - rename or move file
* `mem (free)` - print the number of free memory pages
* `proc (ps)` - list current processes and their state ("+" or "-" -
  activity, "g" for graphical tasks)
* `drop (kill) <ID>` - terminate the process with the given ID
* `date` - print current date and time
* `rem` - do nothing (needed for comments in .bat files)
* `start <path/filename>` - execute the program in the background (by
  default, the executed program blocks `cmd`)
* `copydir <dir1> <dir2>` - recursive copy of the _dir1_ directory with all
  files to the _dir2_ directory. Full paths must be specified, not relative!
* `pause` - wait for a keypress (used in `.bat` files)
* `echo <message>` - print a message (needed for `.bat` files)
* `type <path/filename>` - print file content

You can also use the complex syntax:

    dir > filename.txt
    dir | more.com
    more < filename.txt

The command-line parameters of the .bat file are available through macros
`%0` to `%9` (`%0` contains the filename of the script).

The _idle_ system task launches the `term.com` terminal, which creates
stdin and stdout pipes and launches the shell to execute `autoexec.bat`.
When there is no running process, the _idle_ enters into an infinite loop
and it is waiting for C+M+D key combination (see above).

When launched, the shell looks at its command line and executes it. If the
command line is `cmd.com autoexec.bat`, the shell enters interactive mode
after `autoexec.bat` is executed, otherwise exits. You can start another
independent terminal with `term` command or a network terminal
(`netterm`) accessible via Telnet (TCP/IP port 2323).

nv, nvfast -- Nedovigator, dual-pane file manager
-------------------------------------------------

Keyboard short cuts:

* cursor keys (up, down) - navigate through files
* Home (Symbol Shift+Q) - jump to the first file
* End (Symbol Shift+E) - jump to the last file
* Tab (Caps Shift+Symbol Shift) - change the current panel
* Space - tag file
* `*` - invert tagging
* BackSpace (Caps Shift+0) - switch to the parent directory
* Enter - launch the file under cursor in the blocking mode (`.com`
  and `.$c` are launched directly, other types may use the external
  launchers, see below)
* Enter - execute command line in the blocking mode, then `nv` will release
  the focus and will wait till the end of the called program or till
  `OS_HIDEFROMPARENT`in that program. Text output of the finished program can
  be displayed with the mouse wheel (in `nv`) or Esc (in `nvfast`).
* Caps Shift+Enter or F9 - insert the file name on the command line
* 3 - text files viewer
  - use cursor keys, PageUp (Caps Shift+3), PageDown (Caps Shift+4),
  - F1 - switch encoding,
  - Ins - switch line breaks,
  - Break (Esc, Caps Shift + Space) - exit,
  - Tab (Caps Shift + Symbol Shift) - switch to hex viewer/editor:
    - use cursor for moving control, PgUp, PgDn,
    - input numbers and A-F
    - Caps Shift+Enter or F2 - save,
    - Break (Esc, Caps Shift + Space) - exit,
    - Tab (Caps Shift + Symbol Shift) - go to the normal text viewer
* 4 - open the text editor _texted_ to modify the file under the cursor
* 5 - copy marked files or the file under the cursor to the opposite panel
* 6 - rename the file/directory (do not use "/" and "\" in the name)
* 7 - create a directory in the current panel (Esc [CS+Space] - cancel)
* 8 - delete tagged files (only empty directories are deleted)
* 1 - select a drive in the current panel (cursor, Esc [CS+Space]
  to cancel, Enter - confirm selection)
* 2 - find files (Tab - switch between filename and substring)

  **Note:** Instead of numbers, you can press F1..F10 on the PS/2 keyboard.

* Symbol Shift+1..5 - select sorting mode (by name, extension, size, date, and
  no sorting). The sorting order is reversed if the same mode is invoked a
  second time. The change to a different mode will use the ascending order.
* Break (Esc, Caps Shift + Space) - exit (Esc - cancel, Enter - confirm)

The remaining keys are used to edit the command line (numbers are not
entered when the command line is empty).

The text output of the launched program from the command line is saved (but
not a program launched in another terminal). See above, how to display it.

The configuration file `nv.ext` describes the association which launcher
is used for the given file extension, for example:

    bmp, scr: scratch.com
    bat: cmd.com

texted -- Text editor
---------------------

Provide `texted` with the name of the file for editing as the command line
parameter. The file size is only limited by the amount of available free
memory.

  movement
* Home (Symbol Shift+Q) - jump to the beginning of the line
* End (Symbol Shift+E) - jump to the end of the line
* BackSpace (Caps Shift+0) - delete a character before the cursor
* Del (Caps Shift + 9) - delete a character to the right of the cursor
* Caps Shift+Enter or F2 - save
* Break (Esc, Caps Shift + Space) - exit
* F1 - change encoding (866/1251)

Other keys are used to input the text.

basic -- NedoBasic, BASIC interpreter
-------------------------------------

Files with `*.bas` extension can be called as command line parameter.

Data types:

* integers (32bit signed), can be used for boolean values (0=false, -1=true).
  If used as an index for a cycle, they consume more memory,
* strings (up to 255 bytes + zero terminator), also used as an array of
  unsigned bytes,
* one-dimensional arrays of integers (32bit signed).

Variable names must consist of only one alphabetical character, for example:

* `i` (number),
* `a$` (string),
* `a(10)` (10th element of the array, counting from 0),
* `a$(10)` (10th character of the string, counting from zero).

The following operations are used in expressions:

* lowest priority: =, <, >, <=, >=, <>
* medium priority: +, -
* high priority: * and /
* highest priority: unary -, expression brackets ()

The function `$rnd` generates random numbers in the range 0..65535,
at least one space must be used after the function name!

Commands (it is possible to join several commands on one line separated by a
colon):

* `run` - start the program
* `list` - view the listing of the program
* `quit` - exit NedoBasic
* `edit <expression>` - call to edit the line with the specified number
* `clear` - clear variables
* `new` - erase the program
* `let <variable>=<expression>`
* `print <expression>; <expression>` - if the last character is a semicolon,
   then no line feed is printed at the end)
* `cls` - clear the screen in black
* `goto <expression>` - jump to the specified line number. When the
   number does not exist the program will continue from the next line
   after the used one.
* `if <expression> then <command>` - if expression is not false, execute
   commands to the end of the line
* `dim <variable> (<expression>)` - create an array of specified size
* `for <variable>=<initial value expression> to <final value expression>
   step <step expression>` - the beginning of the cycle. Step can be positive
   or negative, but not 0.
* `rem <text>` - use for text comments
* `next <variable>` - the end of for-cycle
* `gfx 0` - enable graphic mode 320x200x16 colors
* `gfx 6` - enable text mode (when the program exits, it will automatically
  enable text mode back)
* `pause` - waiting for the keypress
* `plot <x-expr>, <y-expr>, <color-expr>` - draw a point in the graphic mode
* `line <x2-expr>, <y2-expr>, <color-expr>` - draw a line in the graphic mode
   (from the previous point or the end of the previous line)
*  `save <filename>` - save the program. The filename can contain the
   path, for example, "m:/path/file.bas". The filename can be also
   a string variable.
* `load <filename>` - load a program. The filename can contain the
   path, for example, "m:/path/file.bas". The filename can be also a
   string variable.
* `system <command_line>` - launch a command via `cmd`, it is waiting for
   completion. Also, a string variable can be used.

Press Esc (Break, CS+Space) to break the execution of the program
or code scrolling.

tp -- Turbo Pascal 3.0 by Borland
---------------------------------

Short cuts are displayed on the screen. Source code can be compiled to the
memory or file. English documentation is located in:

    http://www.retroarchive.org/docs/software/turbodoc.html

See examples - `t.pas` ("Hello" in a cycle), `mc.pas` (spreadsheet).

cc, cc2, clink, c.ccc, deff.crl, deff2.crl -- BDS C compiler
------------------------------------------------------------

BDS C compiler was developed by Brain Damage Software. Example:
`cc.bat ex` (compile `ex.c`, link and run the code).

```
#include <stdio.h>

main(argc, argv)
char **argv;
{
  int i;
  printf("Hello world!\n");

  for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) printf("Arg #%d = %s\n",i,argv[i]);

  getchar();
}
```

Compiler collection examples and usage:

* `cc filename.c`
* `cc2` - second compilation is invoked automatically
* Object files and libraries have the `.crl` extension (deff2.crl is
  automatically connected by the linker). Examples of libraries are
`deff2a.csm`, `deffgfx.csm`.
* Link object file to executable:
  - `clink filename`
  - `clink filename deffgfx` (see `cc.bat` and example `ex.c`)
* How to build the concatenation tool (`concat outfile infile1 infile2`):
  - `cc concat.c`
  - `clink concat`

playtap -- Player for `.tap` files.
-----------------------------------

TAP files are played on your physical tape output. The file to play must be
named `tilt.tap`.

Programming (for details see `api_base.txt`)
---------------------------------------------

User programs are compiled with the header file `../_sdk/sys_h.asm`, which
includes the file `sysdefs.asm` with constants.

Programs are loaded and run with `PROGSTART` (0x0100), with the command line in
`COMMANDLINE` (0x0080) and with its length stored at `COMMANDLINE_sz` (0x0080).
It is highly recommended to use these constants rather than numeric values (the
same goes for key codes, call numbers, etc.). The stack initially grows from
the top of 0x0000, it can be manually rearranged to any place above 0x3b00.
File operations and data transfers in BDOS can be done at any address in
the userspace.

It is not recommended to read keyboard ports manually, use `OS_GETKEYMATRIX` -
it returns the pressed keys only to the task that is currently in focus.

It is not recommended to use the `syssets.asm` dependency in user programs.

Application developers use the symbolic key names defined in `sysdefs.asm` under
"Usable key codes".

The system is currently unable to assemble itself. To reach this goal, we will
follow a number of guidelines for programming in assembly language:

* it is not recommended to use external utilities (`*.exe`) for building
  programs, except for the assembler and the NedoLang package.
* it is recommended to format hexadecimal numbers in the 0xffff format, it is
  not recommended to use binary numbers (in extreme cases, write in the 0b0101
  format).
* it is recommended to write arithmetic expressions so that they are executed
  correctly even in the absence of priority of operations. If this requires
  starting an expression with a parenthesis, write a + sign before the
  parenthesis.
* it is recommended to write arithmetic expressions so that they are executed
  correctly in unsigned multiplication and division.
* it is not recommended to use `ifn a == b`, use `if a != b`.
* it is not recommended to use `ORG` other than the initial one. Use `ds addr-$`.
* it is not recommended to use `DUP..EDUP`, you can use `include` for large
  blocks, and expand small ones.
* it is not recommended to use `EQU` and `STRUCT`, use the "=" sign.
* it is not recommended to use digital labels and transitions of type 1b
  (especially transitions of type 1f!).
* it is not recommended to write several commands in a line and several sets of
  parameters for one command.
* it is not recommended to use UTF-8 encoding, use Windows-1251 or CP866
  instead.

As the native build system will be improved, these restrictions will be relaxed.

Restarts in the kernel (it is highly recommended to use them through macros
since it is planned to free 0x0000 for the user, make `CALLBDOS` a restart, and
`SETPG...` calls for speed):

* `QUIT (0x0000)` - close the current task and free its memory
* `CALLBDOS (0x0005)` - calling BDOS (see functions in `sys_h.asm`, function
  number in C). You should not call this macro directly, for each command there
  is a separate macro `OS_...`. Registers are not saved!
* `OS_GETKEY (0x0008)` - read a key (HA=code with language, BC=code without
  language, key codes are specified in `sysdefs.asm`) and read the mouse at the
  same time (de=mouse position (y, x), l=mouse buttons (bits 0, 1, 2:
  0=pressed)), and also Kempston joystick (LX),
  nz=the program is not in focus, the buttons are shown empty,
  the mouse position must be ignored (=0)
* `OS_PRCHAR (0x0010)` - print character A (registers are not saved!)
* `SETPG4000 (0x0018)` - enable page A at 0x4000 (corrupts the BC register). The
  page number is stored in (CURPG16K)
* `SETPG8000 (0x0020)` - enable page A at 0x8000 (corrupts the BC register).
  The page number is stored in (CURPG32KLOW)
* `SETPGC000 (0x0028)` - enable page A at 0xc000 (corrupts the BC register).
  The page number is stored in (CURPG32KHIGH) (switch the page at 0x0000 via
  `OS_SETMAINPAGE`, while the page must have a kernel!)
* 0x0030 - far call is planned
* 0x0038 - interrupt handler

BDOS functions: see `sys_h.asm`.

The entry to the standard interrupt handler looks like this:

```
    push af
    push bc
    push de
```

How to capture an interrupt handler in your program:

* replace 3 bytes at 0x0038 with `jp <address of your handler>`, and take the
  `intjp` address from 0x0038+3 and copy to yourself.

For example:

```
swapimer                    ;the first call will turn on your handler,
                            ;the second call will return the standard handler
        di
        ld hl, (0x0038 + 3) ;address intjp
        ld (intjpaddr), hl
        ld de, 0x0038
        ld hl, oldimer
        ld bc, 3
swapimer0
        ld a, (de)
        ldi                ;[oldimer] -> [0x0038]
        dec hl
        ld (hl), a         ;[0x0038] -> [oldimer]
        inc hl
        jp pe, swapimer0
        ei
        ret
oldimer
        jp on_int          ;will be replaced with the code from 0x0038
        jp 0x0038 + 3
```

* your interrupt handler should call `oldimer`.  For example:

```
on_int
        ex de, hl         ;de = "hl", hl = "de"
        ex (sp), hl       ;hl = exit address, de = "hl", on the stack "de"
        ld (on_int_jp), hl
        ld ( on_int_sp), SP
        ld sp, INTSTACK   ;in order not to mess up the stack
        push af
        push bc
        push de           ;"hl"
        ...
        call oldimer      ;ei
        ...
        pop de            ;"hl"
        pop bc
        pop af
on_int_sp = $ + 1
    ld sp , 0
; de = "hl", on the stack "de"
        pop de
        ;
```

* do not use `YIELD`, use `HALT` instead. Otherwise, the interrupt will go to
  another task, and there is another interrupt handler.
* Call NedoOS functions (except for page switching) either in the interrupt
  handler or immediately after HALT.
* if you just install your music player, use `OS_SETMUSIC`, while you can ignore
  the previous two points (music will work anyway).

The disk subsystem is based on the FatFS library with drivers from Savelij13
and DimkaM and the iofast library from the NedoLang suite.

The operating system idea was brought in 2007 when the first version of the
kernel was written (but never tested). The main portion of the kernel code,
`cmd` and `nv`, and part of Scratch graphic editor was written in 2018.

System setup
------------

Clock usage according to Mr. Gluk's schematics for ATM2 is tested in
UnrealSpeccy 0.37.1.

Disk images (the HDD image can be mounted through WinImage, and the SD-card
image can be mounted in Windows). Do not forget to unmount it once done:

    http://alonecoder.nedopc.com/sd.zip
    http://alonecoder.nedopc.com/hdd.zip

Installing the system on a real HDD:

1. Run `mkatm2.bat` (or `mkatm3.bat` for ATM3).
2. Using `nv`, copy all the files from the `*.trd` received to `e:/bin/`.
3. Run `mkatm2hd.bat` (or `mkatm3hd.bat` for ATM3), copy the resulting `*.$c`
   to drive 1.

Then you can start the system (`*.$c`) from the HDD.

Installation of the system on a real SD-card: copy the `bin/` directory and
the required `$c` to the root of a SD-card.

Settings for the UnrealSpeccy emulator:

```
[ZC]            ; Z-Controller settings
; sdcard image
SDCARD="sd.vhd"

[HDD]
Scheme = NEMO-DIVIDE (for ATM3 version) or ATM (for ATM2 version)

Image0 = hdd.ima
CHS0=609/16/63  ; max size, accessible through CHS. not used for real drive
LBA0=614400     ; max size, accessible through LBA. not used for real drive
HD0RO=0         ; read only flag
CD0=0           ; 1 if image is cdrom
```

`eVHDattach.bat` (you can mount also by clicking on `*.vhd`):

```
d:
cd zx\us035\
@echo off
if exist VHDattach.txt (
    @echo on
    echo VHDattach.txt exist
    @echo off
) else (
    @echo on
    echo create VHDattach.txt
    @echo off
    echo select vdisk file="%cd%\sd.vhd" > VHDattach.txt
    echo attach vdisk >> VHDattach.txt
    rem echo select vdisk file="%cd%\sd.vhd" >> VHDattach.txt
    rem echo select part 1 >> VHDattach.txt
    rem echo assign letter=K >> VHDattach.txt
)
if exist sd.vhd (
    @echo on
    echo sd.vhd attach
    diskpart /s VHDattach.txt
    @echo off
) else (
    @echo on
    echo create VHDcreate.txt
    @echo off
    echo create vdisk file="%cd%\sd.vhd" MAXIMUM=300 TYPE=FIXED >
VHDcreate.txt
    echo select vdisk file="%cd%\sd.vhd" >> VHDcreate.txt
    echo attach vdisk >> VHDcreate.txt
    echo create part primary  >> VHDcreate.txt
    echo select part 1 >> VHDcreate.txt
    echo format label="ZX" quick fs=FAT32 >> VHDcreate.txt
    echo assign >> VHDcreate.txt
    @echo on
    diskpart /s VHDcreate.txt
    del VHDcreate.txt
    @echo off
)
@echo on
pause
```

`eVHDdetach.bat:`

```
d:
cd zx\us035\
@echo off
if exist VHDdetach.txt (
    @echo on
    echo VHDdetach.txt exist
    @echo off
) else (
    @echo on
    echo create VHDdetach.txt
    @echo off
    echo select vdisk file="%cd%\sd.vhd" > VHDdetach.txt
    echo detach vdisk >> VHDdetach.txt
)
@echo on
diskpart /s VHDdetach.txt
pause
```

On Windows 10, you can use right-click to mount and unmount.
